# Cyberbullying-classification
classify text as either cyberbullying or not

## Challenges

When dealing with a class like not_cyberbullying that contains a wide range of topics and content types (e.g., reality shows, daily life, general comments), the challenge is that this class becomes very diverse and less cohesive compared to more specific classes (like ethnicity or gender in the context of cyberbullying). This diversity makes it difficult for the model to learn a consistent pattern, often resulting in lower recall and precision for the not_cyberbullying class.
